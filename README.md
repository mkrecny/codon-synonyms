## Codon Synonyms in JSON

DNA has redundancy. These files allow you to easily import synonymous codons into
your project as JSON for uses such as genetic data analysis.

Each JSON file maps codons to other 'synonymous' codons.

Each key is a codon, and each value is an array of synonymous codons.

## File Descriptions
`synonyms.min.json` includes a 'minified' one-line version of all the mappings to reduce file size.

`synonyms.json` includes a pretty-printed version of the mappings on separate lines so they're easier to read.
